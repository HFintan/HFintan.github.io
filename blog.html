<p> Panicked so much last night that things were almost over before they began, but I met with the supervisor today and it seems things may be workable after all. Also went to Birmingham City and spent a full hour being directed from pillar to post and back again, before finally finding the estate agent's office to promise them all of my money, five minutes walk from where I'd first asked for directions. On my travels, I was approached by a young lass who claimed she was a photography student doing a fashion shoot. Readers who know me, which presumably covers all of you, may recall that I am not the most fashionable of individuals, or you might recall the episode of Black Books where Manny runs away and is taken in by a kindly photographer. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNWNeXYJVA8">Watch it</a>  - it's good! Personally, I was reminded of what the lovely <a href="http://boards.sin.ie/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=20244&p=626574">Alan</a> said about me back in 2009:
<p><i>Imagining you doing a fashion show is frightening.<br>

"Well you need a jacket with massive pockets to fit lots of jaffa cakes in.."</i><p>
Anyway, I declined her offer. I also bought a new phone in Carphone Warehouse, but they didn't give me a sim card. Yay.<p>

<p> I wandered down to a local chipper yesterday evening. First I was stopped by a man with blood all down his face who claimed he'd been mugged and was looking for Â£2 for the bus home. Even if he was just scamming me, I appreciated the effort he had put in, so I gave him the money and went on my way. Five minutes later I was done out of another couple of quid by someone with no story whatsoever - I resented that one, but given that I was carrying a couple of hundred in my pocket, I didn't want to prolong our interaction. Makes one appreciate the buskers and sitting beggars one finds in Galway - not something I'd expected to miss. Met the supervisor and some admin staff today - the most fun part of which was the delightful "Catch 22" of needing a residential address to open a bank account and a bank account to rent a property. It took me hours to get around that one. Advice to those of you who might find yourselves in a similar situation - use Lloyd's.
Then I viewed the house I'm thinking of renting, which didn't look quite as well as in the photographs...<p>

<p>I've been in Birmingham for an entire day now and it has not stopped raining. I spent five hours in the library yesterday while waiting for check-in for the hotel. Granted, I was asleep for a substantial portion of that time, but I feel it's a step in the right direction. This morning, I wandered out to the area where I'm thinking of renting. It looks like a bit of a hole, but I asked a local shopkeep, and he informed me that it was a lovely and safe area. Then he sold me a packet of cookies which were seven months out of date. Caveat emptor, I suppose...
On the upside, I saw my first grey squirrel ever, so the trip hasn't been a complete waste. I've only ever seen one red squirrel before - in Germany, twenty-three years ago. Gone in the blink of an eye.
