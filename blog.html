Met the supervisor today. I can't tell whether he thinks I'm an idiot or not yet. He took my phone number and promised that if the weather is fine in the summer we can go for a drive somewhere nice outside the city. I'm not entirely sure whether he was being serious or not. My previous supervisor emailed me yesterday to ask how I was getting on over here - that, I felt was an appropriate level of nice. One of the other guys in the office has a row of chilli plants growing on the windowsill and the other sees fit to have his private phone conversations in the office simply because they're in French. No, I've not managed to glean anything terribly juicy yet. I used my debit card for the first time today. Now I'm terrified that I'll end up bankrupt, whether by someone stealing all my details, or by me getting carried away with the ease of this online purchasing lark. On the upside, I seem to have been paid by the university for the work I have allegedly done so far. Yay! I've not got a useful context, but given the day that's in it, the phrase "Now is the winter of our discoth√©que..." has formulated itself in my head and will not go away.
