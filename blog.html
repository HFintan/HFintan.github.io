<p> I had to laugh earlier when I saw the "Customers must be eighteen or over to purchase this product." sticker on a box of cutlery. I'm not laughing now, as I bleed all over the keyboard, after slicing my finger when removing one of the knives from its packaging. I bled a little on my pizza too, but that's okay, because it was carbonised beyond edibility in this oven which has a number of unhelpful settings, illustrated by unintelligible little diagrams. The washer-dryer seems a little more straightforward, except the "dryer" part of it does not seem at all effective. I am in my new house, in case you had not guessed, where I shall be for the next six months unless I want to forfeit a rather hefty £1200 deposit. I had not expected my stay in Birmingham to be a financially profitable one, but it would be nice if it doesn't end up eating into my savings.<br>
I was feeling reasonably optimistic when I arrived at my new lodgings, but, while looking out a window where I was initially reassured to see a child's play house in the back yard of the house next door, its plastic door having been chewed to shreds and the many massive lumps of shit lying about the yard suggesting that it is being used as a kennel instead, took the rather thin sheen of things. Probably for the best, as there were bags of rubbish stacked atop the plastic house, and it would probably have been none too sanitary accommodation for a child. The thin walls later informed me that there are, in fact, a dog and at least two very young children in the house. Having lived in a detached house all my life, it's going to be difficult not to get anxious every time I hear a noise pretty much anywhere.<br>
I called in to Carphone Warehouse today, so 02 will post me out a new sim card. However, not wishing to be unable to communicate with you, dear reader, as the Maths department seems to be inconveniently closed on the weekends, I spent £60 on a dongle, which I'm sure is a stupid amount. I haven't figured out how to turn on the heating. <br>
There are peculiar scratchmarks on the door from the kitchen into the rest of the house. I do hope the house isn't haunted or troubled by junkies.<br>
I've been in Birmingham for a week now and, aside from the accommodation, I reckon I'd be happy enough here for a few months at least. If I managed to get a barge for my next accommodation though, that would be pretty awesome, I suspect.

<p> Saw two squirrels this morning, and one of them even jumped from one tree to another, but it wasn't quite as exciting this time around. However, I did see my first ever jay and tufted ducks this morning, and a squirrel on the ground only a few metres away from me. These, all while I walked to the next town to deposit all of my money in the estate agents' bank account.
I spent a lot of time in the office doing very little today, but became acutely aware of the music school just at the back of our office. It's great to have a music school, don't get me wrong, and it's nice to here the sounds of the piano drift up of an evening, but today there was a soprano practising scales for over an hour and it did my fecking head in. Like something from a haunting horror film.
The previous debacle over needing an address for a bank account and a bank account for an address resulted in my having given the hotel as my address. This was a matter for some concern, as after tonight it will no longer be my address. Fortunately, however, the mail arrived today and I am now the proud owner of a shiny new debit card. It was no longer possible to avoid getting one. Now I'll probably go mad and buy everything on the internet.<p>

<p> I saw THREE squirrels this morning. One of them jumped FROM one tree TO another. And sure isn't that about all you could want from a morning? I also got a text from 02:
"<i>Want to know more about what impact the Tuam Sugar Factory has on Galway, its people and the surrounding areas? Make sure to check out TG4 Croi an Cheantair, anocht at 8pm. This is the second in a six part series. T&Cs apply.</i>"
I also did some maths research today and understood some stuff, which was fun. Then I came home and found that the cleaner had removed my toothbrush and toothpaste. Maybe they're going to clone me or something.<p>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 16th</span></big>
<p> Seems the University here uses Windows 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Outlook - and they wonder why everything is so painfully slow. Had lunch with a friend of a friend of a friend today, in the interests of not becoming a recluse. Coincidentally, this friend of a friend of a friend was one of the people I stopped to ask for directions in the city centre yesterday. Small world, eh?
On my way home, I was attacked by a crow. Nothing too traumatic - it cawed harshly at me as I passed, and then flew over my head and flapped its wings at my hair a little, and then returned to its perch on the railing. What a dick. The sun came out for the first time since I've arrived, so I took the evening off and spent it watching cheery youtube videos, like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKC-lRhvdNY>this one</a>.<p>


<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 15th</span></big>
<p> Was panicking a bit last night, but I met with the supervisor today and it seems things may be workable after all. Also went to Birmingham City and spent a full hour being directed from pillar to post and back again, before finally finding the estate agent's office to promise them all of my money, five minutes walk from where I'd first asked for directions. On my travels, I was approached by a young lass who claimed she was a photography student doing a fashion shoot. Readers who know me, which presumably covers all of you, may recall that I am not the most fashionable of individuals, or you might recall the episode of Black Books where Manny runs away and is taken in by a kindly photographer. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNWNeXYJVA8">Watch it</a>  - it's good! Personally, I was reminded of what the lovely Alan (aka ddy) said about me back in 2009:
<p><i>Imagining you doing a fashion show is frightening.<br>

"Well you need a jacket with massive pockets to fit lots of jaffa cakes in.."</i><p>
Anyway, I declined her offer. I also bought a new phone in Carphone Warehouse, and the box promised a sim card and a micro sim card, but unless they were both very fucking micro indeed, there seemed to be no sim card at all. Yay.
Went to the UoB chess club and managed not to lose any games, but there was apparently a team match on which all the best players are at.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 14th</span></big>
<p> I wandered down to a local chipper yesterday evening. First I was stopped by a man with blood all down his face who claimed he'd been mugged and was looking for £2 for the bus home. Even if he was just scamming me, I appreciated the effort he had put in, so I gave him the money and went on my way. Five minutes later I was done out of another couple of quid by someone with no story whatsoever - I resented that one, but given that I was carrying a couple of hundred in my pocket, I didn't want to prolong our interaction. Makes one appreciate the buskers and sitting beggars one finds in Galway - not something I'd expected to miss. Met the supervisor and some admin staff today - the most fun part of which was the delightful "Catch 22" of needing a residential address to open a bank account and a bank account to rent a property. It took me hours to get around that one. Advice to those of you who might find yourselves in a similar situation - use Lloyd's.
Then I viewed the house I'm thinking of renting, which didn't look quite as well as in the photographs...<p>

<p>I've been in Birmingham for an entire day now and it has not stopped raining. I spent five hours in the library yesterday while waiting for check-in for the hotel. Granted, I was asleep for a substantial portion of that time, but I feel it's a step in the right direction. This morning, I wandered out to the area where I'm thinking of renting. It looks like a bit of a hole, but I asked a local shopkeep, and he informed me that it was a lovely and safe area. Then he sold me a packet of cookies which were seven months out of date. Caveat emptor, I suppose...
On the upside, I saw my first grey squirrel ever, so the trip hasn't been a complete waste. I've only ever seen one red squirrel before - in Germany, twenty-three years ago. Gone in the blink of an eye.
