In the interests of setting myself up for getting around to properly working a 9-5 from Monday to Friday, I did no work today. I believe it was an important step. I did cook porridge for the first time. Far too much of it, and then I killed it completely with raisins. Edible though. Went to the pub in the evening for dinner and chess with Mark, Dom and Piotr. Played terribly though. Steven, another chess player, joined us for a couple of games. Then they headed off for poker but I declined, fully intent on being in the office for 9 in the morning and working a full day before table tennis. Faffed about on the internet until 4am.
