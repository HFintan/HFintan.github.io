Well, I spent almost the entirety of today writing an algorithm. It is useless, I think, but it was more fun than reading relevant research papers. The idea is that you have an equation <i>Ax=b</i> where <i>A</i> is an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> matrix, <i>b</i> is a vector of length <i>n</i>, and <i>x</i> is a vector of length <i>m</i>, which has <i>k</i> non-zero entries which have integer values between 1 and <i>t</i>. The algorithm takes, as input, the matrix <i>A</i>, the sparsity <i>k</i> and the upper bound for the integers <i>t</i>. It then calculates all possible <i>b</i>s given those constraints. Actually, I spent today generalising the algorithm - I had most of it done yesterday evening for the case <i>k=2</i>. I enjoyed it though, which is the important thing. That was the height of today's excitement. I also booked train tickets for tomorrow's trip to London. The cheapest I could get cost about £72 return which is a bit fucking ridiculous. From now on, I'll be taking the bus. It doesn't look like the two friends I had hoped to meet tomorrow will be able to meet up - one is recording and the other has an "infected graze". So I should have twelve hours' worth of London adventures to relate tomorrow. How exciting. Oh, also, it seems that Mark left the front door unlocked for most of today and we weren't burgled! Yay! I don't feel comfortable ending this post on a high note though, so... another thing which bugs me about Birmingham are the pedestrian crossings. I hate when there's one car driving along the road and they feel obliged to wave you across. It doesn't do anyone any good.

Imagine I have painted an image which comprises a line of four pixels. You know that there are only 256 possible values for each of these pixels. Further, assume that you know that only two of the pixels are coloured in. Imagine the pixels are very heavy and I can afford only one carrier pigeon. You might think that to reconstruct the image you would need to know both the values of the two coloured-in pixels and their positions in the row of pixels. However, using the matrix <br>
<div class="math">
	<table class="matrixbracket"

	<tr>
	<td>
		<table class="nibs"

			frame="hsides" rules="none">

		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		</table>
	</td>
	<td>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="7" class="matrix">
		<tr>	<td><i>-61</i></td> <td><i>-5</i></td> <td><i>191</i></td> <td><i>-379</i></td></tr>
		<tr>	<td><i>-233</i></td> <td><i>401</i></td> <td><i>101</i></td> <td><i>29</i></td></tr>
		</table>
	</td>

you can recover the original masterpiece from a mere two values! That matrix isn't unique, but it took me almost as long to find as it did to try and construct it in html.<br>
In other news, Mark arrived, we went to the shop, got soaked, played chess, cooked two pizzas because they were too big to fit in the oven... it was all terribly exciting. I also had coconut milk, which is stupidly sweet and not at all as nice as one might have imagined.

<p>You'll be glad to hear that I survived. Aside from that, I have nothing of note to report. I went into the bank briefly, and couldn't remember my pin code, so had to get them to issue me with a new one. I, once more, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against my chess nemesis here. Played a lot of blitz swap-chess too. It was, insofar as blitz swap-chess can be, of a reasonable standard. It's possible that the maths are about to get interesting. We shall see. I used GAP again today. Though I'm probably heading in the wrong direction, the journey is, at least, interesting.

Bought some stuff for when the horde of people wanting to visit me start showing up. Bedlinen, pots, pans, an extra plate and so on... Then I went to the office for a while and did some trying to understand stuff. Then I went home and did some cooking with my fancy new pots, largely at the behest of people who insisted that I shouldn't be eating sandwiches and pasties all of the time. I neglected to soak the pots first, which, apparently, you're supposed to do. I put on far too much rice, but fortunately half of it stuck to the non-stick saucepan which saved me having to eat it. And the rice I could detach from the pot was undercooked and a little crunchy. Are there consequences to eating undercooked rice? Yes, the general consensus seems to be, if, like a pigeon, you eat too much and your stomach swells up and bursts and you die. I know - I consulted the internet.
"<i>It's not unhealthy, but the rice will swell in your stomach. If you eat a large amount, you could certainly have discomfort. In extreme cases, your stomach could even burst.</i>" Not unhealthy, eh?<br>
Eating uncooked rice can also increase your menstrual flow.<br>
I had a tin of beans and, for meat, a packet of <a href="http://mediaserver.dwpub.com/press-release/2702/36630.jpg">Findus crispy pancakes</a>. The latter are succulent gravy and meat filling wrapped in cardboard, and chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall apparently swears by them. I must admit, I swore a little too. Tune in tomorrow, for more delicious recipes &agrave; la moi, or to see if I have avoided an exploding stomach and menstrual bleeding.

<p> Lazy start to the day, but eventually went for a walk to find the nearest guitar shop. Many, many guitars, lots of kids playing electric guitars so loud I could barely hear what I was playing myself, and so many staff waiting to pounce when one made a decision that the entire process was quite uncomfortable. Eventually picked out a <a href="http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/baby-mahogany">Baby Taylor</a> for about £300 including various bits, then spent the whole walk home regretting having been subtly pressurised into making a snap decision (after about an hour of trying a selection of guitars in the shop) but then when I got in and played the guitar a bit, I was very happy with my purchase. Yay! Also, on my walk home with the guitar I passed a guy and his two daughters heading in the same direction, lugging a pallet. I offered him a hand, and during the course of the stroll it transpired that he, too, played guitar, and he invited me to come and join himself and a couple of people he jams with. He took my email address and promised to send me a list of the stuff that they play. We shall see what becomes of that. The healthiest thing I had to eat today was two bowls of Alpen. That stuff is about 37% sugar. Ridiculous.

Met the supervisor today. I can't tell whether he thinks I'm an idiot or not yet. He took my phone number and promised that if the weather is fine in the summer we can go for a drive somewhere nice outside the city. I'm not entirely sure whether he was being serious or not. My previous supervisor emailed me yesterday to ask how I was getting on over here - that, I felt was an appropriate level of nice. One of the other guys in the office has a row of chilli plants growing on the windowsill and the other sees fit to have his private phone conversations in the office simply because they're in French. No, I've not managed to glean anything terribly juicy yet. I used my debit card for the first time today. Now I'm terrified that I'll end up bankrupt, whether by someone stealing all my details, or by me getting carried away with the ease of this online purchasing lark. On the upside, I seem to have been paid by the university for the work I have allegedly done so far. Yay! I've not got a useful context, but given the day that's in it, the phrase "Now is the winter of our discothéque..." has formulated itself in my head and will not go away.
