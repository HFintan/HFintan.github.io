<p>I've been in Birmingham for an entire day now and it has not stopped raining. I spent five hours in the library yesterday while waiting for check-in for the hotel. Granted, I was asleep for a substantial portion of that time, but I feel it's a step in the right direction. This morning, I wandered out to the area where I'm thinking of renting. It looks like a bit of a hole, but I asked a local shopkeep, and he informed me that it was a lovely and safe area. Then he sold me a packet of cookies which were seven months out of date. Caveat emptor, I suppose...
On the upside, I saw my first grey squirrel ever, so the trip hasn't been a complete waste. I've only ever seen one red squirrel before - in Germany, twenty-two years ago. Gone in the blink of an eye.
