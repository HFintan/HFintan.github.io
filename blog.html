Arose late, as is my wont. Wandered into town but the pubs we sought to eat in were wedged so we found a crappy take-away. Then we wandered about looking for a bar with a free table until Piotr arrived and brought us to a really nice place. Studenty, granted, but with tables and a pool table. I won the pool, as Piotr was distracted by some drunk lass and Mark just wasn't very good. My chess wasn't great, but my final game of the evening was a triumph. After dropping my queen on about move seven against Piotr, I managed to hound his king around the board until we reached the position shown here. White to play! Oddest end position I've seen in a very long time.<br>

On that note, I wandered home.

Did some maths, but understood sweet eff all. Topped up my internet, whereupon 3 kindly promised to remember all my details so that I only had to fill in the CSV number the next time I wanted to use the card on this laptop. Bastards. Then they wouldn't allow me to log in to remove the credit card details. Ugh. On the upside, I had a penguin pie for dinner - no penguin in it, mind - and it was lovely.

On account of today being my birthday, I took the day off. I wandered in to the market on campus and picked up a few pies which no one was able to join me for. Spent the day eating chocolate and arsing about on the internet. The only mildly productive thing I did was to set up a paypal account.

This day last year I defended my viva. Seems a fecking age ago. So today wasn't quite as productive, I suppose. Did do some maths though!
Then I went to chess where I lost to some new young lad who is definitely a better player than I am, but I managed to get a couple of the games of him. Then I threw a game away against another guy in the opening. Should I start naming these players as the blog devolves into a scoresheet? The young guy was Joe and the other guy was Dwayne. I hope you're happy.

Got up early this morning and felt absolutely awful. I won't be making that mistake again. Convinced by the pain in my jaw that there was something seriously wrong with my wisdom tooth and regretting that I'd missed the deadline to sign up for the university's dental plan for the moment, I found a dentist and was ushered into the waiting room. The waiting time was brief (but long enough for the pain in my jaw had moved around to the back of my head where it remained for the rest of the day) but the time spent in the dentist's room was less than three minutes -no exaggeration. Apparently my teeth are all perfect apart from that one wisdom tooth which has a slight infection. The charge for the check-up was £18. They didn't have change of a £20 in the till. I mean, come on...<br>
Anyway, my good intentions to start early marred by this delay and the headache, today wasn't as productive as it ought to have been, but I did do some work, including starting to read a paper which contains the footnote "In any <i>n</i>-dimensional vector space, a basis will always consist of exactly <i>n</i> vectors. Fewer vectors are not sufficient to span the space, while additional vectors are guaranteed to be linearly dependent." This, of course, puts massive pressure on me to understand everything else in the paper - even if it is aimed at engineers.<br>
Dom, Mark and I went to tabletennis this evening. Our standard was pretty poor, and I don't know if the other two will come back. To be fair, though, the trampoline club uses the hall at the same time and the young ladies' constant bouncing was very distracting. It would not be unfair to conjecture that our playing suffered.<br>
Could not gain access to my office after tabletennis, so I had no laptop for the evening and had foolishly done all my washing up a couple of days ago, and couldn't play guitar for fear of disturbing the bairns next door, so I just had a shower and was in bed before 9. Shocking state of affairs.<br> 
My PhD supervisor sent me a link today to an interesting postdoc in Bologna. 10k per annum more than I'm getting here, and closer to what I did the phd in, but I'm not a huge fan of Italians, to be racistly<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jVAHAuiS4">[4]</a> general, and they don't have any canals. It doesn't start 'til September, so no harm in throwing in an application, I suppose.<br>

In the interests of setting myself up for getting around to properly working a 9-5 from Monday to Friday, I did no work today. I believe it was an important step. I did cook porridge for the first time. Far too much of it, and then I killed it completely with raisins. Edible though. Went to the pub in the evening for dinner and chess with Mark, Dom and Piotr. Played terribly though. Steven, another chess player, joined us for a couple of games. Then they headed off for poker but I declined, fully intent on being in the office for 9 in the morning and working a full day before table tennis. Faffed about on the internet until 4am.
