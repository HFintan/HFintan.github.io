Arose at the crack of noon today and that sort of set the tone for the rest of the day as far as productivity was concerned. I did fix the issue with the laptop not recording videos with a simple sudo apt-get install. 'Of what benefit is that to your research?', I hear you ask. None whatsoever. As I was leaving the office, I espied the unmistakeable visage of Billy Crystal in "The Princess Bride" being projected onto a wall in the building behind mine. Irrelevant, but it put me in a good mood for some reason. On the aforementioned NSPCC table of books and dvds whence I previously purchased my pirated copy of "The Pirates of the Carribean", I noticed what appeared to be a pornographic dvd - "Fat Slags on tour" or somesuch. I did not invest.<br>
Suzanne Vega is playing Birmingham in February! Excellent. A perk of living in a big city is, I suppose, that there ought to be better gigs. The difficulty is, of course, finding them amongst all the shit that is also advertised.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 24th</span></big><p>
Slightly more productive day today. Wandered to Harborne with Mark. Was in Iceland for the first time ever, but given that they sell almost exclusively frozen foodstuffs which would have defrosted by the time I'd walked home, I could only buy a shitload of sweets. Went to Waitrose for the first time ever too, where I managed to get something more appropriate for dinner, though I had to buy chicken kievs as I could not afford the normal chicken. Also bought oat milk for the first time - it tastes surprisingly like normal milk, apart from the oaty aftertaste. We also found some Lir chocolate with Guinness, which was okay. What a day.<br>
Then I went into the office and did sweet eff all, but it was warmer than staying at home. Eventually, I had to wander home and cook dinner. Not bad enough that I had to eat garlicy chicken, but the packet of rice my parents had left in the press was some poxy microwaveable Indian-spiced crap. My own parents! I ask you. Fortunately I could mask the taste with a tin of beans and rely on yorkshire puddings for supplementary carbohydratey goodness. I watched an episode of Poirot too, but the sodding DVD stops just as Inspector Poirot delivers his final judgement. Who killed the fucking dentist??
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 23rd</span></big><p>
Having no inclination to do mathematics today, and no obligation to go visiting places with people or even to organise food, I simply spent the entirety of today in bed. Given that it is about ten degrees celsius outside my blanket, according to this little device which seems to tell the time and temperature, I felt fully justified in leaving the comfort of my bed only to obtain chocolate.
I see Birmingham has just been voted the No. 1 city to visit in the UK. So now for ya.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 22nd</span></big><p>
After some major panicking this morning trying to devise a satisfactory excuse for not having any work done, it turned out that the supervisor had invited one of his phd students along to hear what I had to tell him. Brilliant. However, he asked what I had to show him and I said that I'd been hoping he could provide some direction, and he pointed out that I was employed by the university as an independent researcher and that he was not my supervisor and I didn't have to report to him. It's true, I suppose, but I'm not sure yet whether this is a good or bad thing. Then he gave an hour-long introduction of sorts to the area to me and his phd student, highlighting possible research problems. I suppose I'd best pick one at some stage.
Meeting over and pressure off, I returned to my office and squandered the day writing a chesssoc email and listening to music.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 21st</span></big><p>
On my own now once more. Sadface. Marginally more productive day today, though still nothing near what I ought to have done for the meeting tomorrow. Time to start thinking of excuses for not having any work done...
Got another email from Waterford IT - seems the position is for a few hours teaching in the evenings. Probably not worth it. Maybe not even worth attending for interview. 
<p>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 20th</span></big><p>
Actually made it into college today for a while! Read a bit of a paper while listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VC58tGG_t4">The Milk Carton Kids</a>. Then I got the train into Birmingham and we went to the Sea Life centre. It was a lot more depressing than the butterfly farm. All of the fish looked really sad. The leopard shark wouldn't even eat anything at feeding time. The very last tank was pretty cool - massive green turtle and a few sharks, and I would have liked to have seen the otters more awake but on the whole, I wouldn't be in a rush back there.<br>
We went for dinner in The Slug and Lettuce though, and I will certainly be heading back there. 
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 19th</span></big><p>
Got the train to Stratford-upon-Avon today. The initial plan was to visit the Lakes, but we ended up going to the village itself. Gorgeous little spot. Any future visitors be advised to visit there. They have two ice-cream barges, geese, and a church with Shakespeare's grave in one wing - complete with a curse in verse for anyone who might contemplate moving the Bard's bones from that spot. What's not to love? They also have a butterfly farm which houses beetles, scorpions, tarantulas, black widow spiders, poison arrow frogs, stick insects, baby quails, some sort of parrots, giant fish - possibly carp?, iguanas, caterpillars, moths and, unsurprisingly, butterflies. The most terrifying part was neither the spiders nor the scorpions, but the butterfly enclosure where huge, beautiful butterflies fluttered about our heads and lay in a most fragile fashion on the ground before our feet. Their amazing ability to fold their wings and look exactly like dead leaves instilled in me a paranoia which stayed long after we had left the farm and strolled through the winter leaves beside the Avon. The children running through the butterfly enclosure suffered no such inhibition and, indeed, we saw some sadly mangled butterflies which seemed to have suffered the inattentive wrath of previous visitors. We didn't see any iguanas though :(
Rounded off the day with the remains of yesterday's Chinese takeaway and it was good.
Received an email from Waterford IT saying I've been shortlisted for a part-time assistant lecturer position I applied for 3 months ago. I think I'll attend for interview anyway, but it's unlikely that I'll disentrench myself from B'ham at this stage - especially after seeing Stratford.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 18th</span></big><p>
Back from an eventful weekend in Ireland complete with an abysmal mathematics lecture given by yours truly, a very successful underwater session of underwater chess due to the new auditor's introduction of magnets, a farewell party to the terrapin which was home to many of us for years, and a few hours spent as so many hours before, faffing about on the internet in the terrapin on my own as all the postgrads have been evicted and sent to a fancy new "research hub". A little sad. The uninitiated may be relieved to note that a "terrapin" is another word for a pre-fab and I did not spend my weekend browsing inside a turtle.<br>
I have been warned, on pain of death, not to embarrass my current guest by blogging that they slipped down the stairs despite my warnings. However, I feel it important to warn potential visitors, so I believe I ought to temporarily avoid execution by simply refraining from naming the aforementioned guest. It is more amusing this way, in any case. Rest assured, no injury greater than that suffered in Chapter 17 of Douglas Adams' "The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy". And that's not even counting the three coffee cups, the micecage, the sperm whale and the bowl of petunias.
The previous tenant dropped by to pick up some letters and he seemed a lovely chap. He told me that they'd had rats last summer. Not altogether surprising given the state of the yard next door.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 13th</span></big><p>
Got up really early again to try help fill in an application for a PhD research scholarship. Then met Stan and Cinta at noon and went for a lovely walk by the canal. We ended up walking as far as Birmingham, though we hadn't realised it until they were on their way back along the canal and I was looking for a train station to get back to the uni and do some more preparation for this fecking talk, which is turning out to be far more work than I expected it to be. We did go for lunch though - my first time ever in the infamous Nando's. It was grand. Even more keen on getting the barge to live on now, after today's walk. Unfortunately, that means I will have to knuckle down and not get kicked out of the postdoc.<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 12th</span></big><p>
Got up early today to give the house a quick tidy and then went into college to get loads of research done before having to go and meet Stan and Cinta at the airport. I didn't quite manage a "load" of research, but I did spend all day working on what I was going to say alongside the slides for this presentation. After dropping their stuff back at the house and satisfying themselves that they wouldn't have to go and find alternative accommodation, we wandered in to Selly Oak to find somewhere to eat. Failing to find anywhere that was quiet, reasonably priced and otherwise satisfactory, we eventually ended up at the first place we'd tried. It was my first meal out in Birmingham, and it was pretty mediocre. Then I abandoned them to go to chess and then the pub with a few guys from chess. It was tremendously exciting.
<p>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 11th</span></big><p>
Spent all day at home working on this talk for Friday. Not alone do I know nothing about the area, I do not know whom I'm supposed to be pitching the talk at, so I don't know whether any linear algebra explanation, for example, is trivial or too difficult. If the horrid facebook event page is anything to go by, the promised attendees range from Maths, Computing and Physics postgrads to people who probably do not even know what a mathematics is. Mark has sorted his accommodation and gone. We both managed not to cry. 
<p>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 10th</span></big><p>
Today we went to CADBURYWORLD! The neighbourhood the dynasty had built for its workers is lovely. There's a delicious smell of chocolate wafting through the air outside. Then we went on the tour through the factory. Seems some European guy was given a Ghanian slave girl and she told him stories of chocolate and some God, and the European then convinced the leader of the Ghanian tribe that he was the God in question, presumably to the end of stealing the secrets of chocolate. Then there were some informative holograms and wobbly benches where Mr. Cadbury's told how he "even employed a costumed Chinaman to work in his shop" as the industry burgeoned under the caring eyes of the Cadbury family who seemed to care only for the welfare of their workers. They fed us with chocolate (including something that tasted like glue with white Buttons in it) so that when we finally made it to the largest Cadbury's shop in the world, we weren't really inclined to buy anything. Still did, mind, but not too much.<br>
We also went for Chinese takeaway. They didn't have chopsticks, but aside from that it was pretty good.
<p>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 9th</span></big><p>
Spent most of today in bed, with the best, but unfulfilled hopes of doing some work. Eventually got up and wandered to Harborne with Mark where we saw OWLS! The birds of prey sanctuary had a few of them out to raise money, but had packed most of them away since the time Mark had spotted them in his earlier wanderings. I was chuffed that I got to see a long-eared owl (I think), a snow owl, a little owl and a common kestrel though. The latter was fecking tiny. Then we explored some charity shops and I bought some cheap (and so far crap) DVDs. Did cook a successful dinner of steak, beans and rice though.<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 8th</span></big><p>
Got up at stupidly early o'clock, caught the train to London, spent most of the trip reading a maths paper, spent an hour wandering around to find the JobCentre, did the interview and then had to kill about eight hours before my train home. I bought credit in the O2 store. That was more exciting than it ought to have been, as the lass working there took my number and then sent me a confirmation text to check it was the right one, which I duly received. Bear with me - instead of giving me a top-up credit piece of paper, what she actually did was to send the credit directly to my phone, which I thought was pretty inefficient, as it saves one having to listen to all the tosh about how "O2 have now made it even easier to top up - now listen while I list all of the stupid ways you could top up, before finally allowing you to top up the way that you want to". However, and here my tale becomes a little non-chronological for I wandered off at this point, I later discovered that the credit had been sent to the wrong phone number. So I had to go back and complain and your one said that she had sent it to the number I had given her, but fortunately I was able to point out that the number I had given her had a text from her and was different to the number on the receipt. She said I'd left it too long to complain, so I had to - for the first time ever - "ask to speak to the manager". I didn't like doing it, but got it sorted in the end. This, combined with the absence of the SIM from the phone when I bought it, and the ridiculous prices over here, lead me, a loyal O2 customer for the past six years or so, to say "Fuck you, O2."<br>
I went for a hot towel shave, which wasn't really the same relaxing experience as with that gent down at the Bridge Mills in Galway. The lack of general hygiene as I bled all over the hot towel and tissue paper was less of a concern than the lunatic customer behind me - a friend of the barbers' - ranting on in unintelligible Brummiese about various life issues he was having and how he was going to deal with those who were allegedly responsible. There was also a woman who came in and sat behind me for a while, next to the chair where I'd left my jacket and rucksack, and then left without much more than a farewell to the barbers. I was trying to roll my eyes around in my head to see whether she were attempting to pilfer what little I had in the bag, but couldn't comfortably turn my head with the razor poised at my throat. It was probably only paranoia and an overactive imagination which made me concerned that the barbers regularly robbed their customers at razor-point. Fleet Street was over two miles away. I survived anyway, not completely unscathed, but at least the bits of skin left hanging off my face didn't have hair on them.<br>
Then I wandered around for over an hour trying to find the train station, only to accidentally take shelter in it when it started to rain. Having thus found my bearings, I searched for something to do, but it was too miserably wet to go much further than the British Library, which is worth seeing if you, for some reason, find yourself in London. Loads of really old books 'n shit. I also bought three books while waiting there for the rain to stop - Kurt Vonnegut, George Bernard Shaw, and Jose Saramago. Cultureful or what?<br>
Then I wandered into another keepsake from a bygone era - an internet café. I played chess online there for about an hour, then wandered back to the train station for a quick bite to eat and an hour or two spent watching the people rushing past to catch their trains.<br>
London is boring. Don't go.<p>

Well, I spent almost the entirety of today writing an algorithm. It is useless, I think, but it was more fun than reading relevant research papers. The idea is that you have an equation <i>Ax=b</i> where <i>A</i> is an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> matrix, <i>b</i> is a vector of length <i>n</i>, and <i>x</i> is a vector of length <i>m</i>, which has <i>k</i> non-zero entries which have integer values between 1 and <i>t</i>. The algorithm takes, as input, the matrix <i>A</i>, the sparsity <i>k</i> and the upper bound for the integers <i>t</i>. It then calculates all possible <i>b</i>s given those constraints. Actually, I spent today generalising the algorithm - I had most of it done yesterday evening for the case <i>k=2</i>. I enjoyed it though, which is the important thing. That was the height of today's excitement. I also booked train tickets for tomorrow's trip to London. The cheapest I could get cost about £72 return which is a bit fucking ridiculous. From now on, I'll be taking the bus. It doesn't look like the two friends I had hoped to meet tomorrow will be able to meet up - one is recording and the other has an "infected graze". So I should have twelve hours' worth of London adventures to relate tomorrow. How exciting. Oh, also, it seems that Mark left the front door unlocked for most of today and we weren't burgled! Yay! I don't feel comfortable ending this post on a high note though, so... another thing which bugs me about Birmingham are the pedestrian crossings. I hate when there's one car driving along the road and they feel obliged to wave you across. It doesn't do anyone any good.

Imagine I have painted an image which comprises a line of four pixels. You know that there are only 256 possible values for each of these pixels. Further, assume that you know that only two of the pixels are coloured in. Imagine the pixels are very heavy and I can afford only one carrier pigeon. You might think that to reconstruct the image you would need to know both the values of the two coloured-in pixels and their positions in the row of pixels. However, using the matrix <br>
<div class="math">
	<table class="matrixbracket"

</div><br>
you can recover the original masterpiece from a mere two values! That matrix isn't unique, but it took me almost as long to find as it did to try and construct it in html.<br>
In other news, Mark arrived, we went to the shop, got soaked, played chess, cooked two pizzas because they were too big to fit in the freezer... it was all terribly exciting. I also had coconut milk, which is stupidly sweet and not at all as nice as one might have imagined.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 5th</span></big>
<p>You'll be glad to hear that I survived. Aside from that, I have nothing of note to report. I went into the bank briefly, and couldn't remember my pin code, so had to get them to issue me with a new one. I, once more, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against my chess nemesis here. Played a lot of blitz swap-chess too. It was, insofar as blitz swap-chess can be, of a reasonable standard. It's possible that the maths are about to get interesting. We shall see. I used GAP again today. Though I'm probably heading in the wrong direction, the journey is, at least, interesting.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 4th</span></big>
<p>
Bought some stuff for when the horde of people wanting to visit me start showing up. Bedlinen, pots, pans, an extra plate and so on... Then I went to the office for a while and did some trying to understand stuff. Then I went home and did some cooking with my fancy new pots, largely at the behest of people who insisted that I shouldn't be eating sandwiches and pasties all of the time. I neglected to soak the pots first, which, apparently, you're supposed to do. I put on far too much rice, but fortunately half of it stuck to the non-stick saucepan which saved me having to eat it. And the rice I could detach from the pot was undercooked and a little crunchy. Are there consequences to eating undercooked rice? Yes, the general consensus seems to be, if, like a pigeon, you eat too much and your stomach swells up and bursts and you die. I know - I consulted the internet.
"<i>It's not unhealthy, but the rice will swell in your stomach. If you eat a large amount, you could certainly have discomfort. In extreme cases, your stomach could even burst.</i>" Not unhealthy, eh?<br>
Eating uncooked rice can also increase your menstrual flow.<br>
I had a tin of beans and, for meat, a packet of <a href="http://mediaserver.dwpub.com/press-release/2702/36630.jpg">Findus crispy pancakes</a>. The latter are succulent gravy and meat filling wrapped in cardboard, and chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall apparently swears by them. I must admit, I swore a little too. Tune in tomorrow, for more delicious recipes &agrave; la moi, or to see if I have avoided an exploding stomach and menstrual bleeding.

<p>Meh.

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 2nd</span></big>
<p> Lazy start to the day, but eventually went for a walk to find the nearest guitar shop. Many, many guitars, lots of kids playing electric guitars so loud I could barely hear what I was playing myself, and so many staff waiting to pounce when one made a decision that the entire process was quite uncomfortable. Eventually picked out a <a href="http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/baby-mahogany">Baby Taylor</a> for about £300 including various bits, then spent the whole walk home regretting having been subtly pressurised into making a snap decision (after about an hour of trying a selection of guitars in the shop) but then when I got in and played the guitar a bit, I was very happy with my purchase. Yay! Also, on my walk home with the guitar I passed a guy and his two daughters heading in the same direction, lugging a pallet. I offered him a hand, and during the course of the stroll it transpired that he, too, played guitar, and he invited me to come and join himself and a couple of people he jams with. He took my email address and promised to send me a list of the stuff that they play. We shall see what becomes of that. The healthiest thing I had to eat today was two bowls of Alpen. That stuff is about 37% sugar. Ridiculous.
<p>

Met the supervisor today. I can't tell whether he thinks I'm an idiot or not yet. He took my phone number and promised that if the weather is fine in the summer we can go for a drive somewhere nice outside the city. I'm not entirely sure whether he was being serious or not. My previous supervisor emailed me yesterday to ask how I was getting on over here - that, I felt was an appropriate level of nice. One of the other guys in the office has a row of chilli plants growing on the windowsill and the other sees fit to have his private phone conversations in the office simply because they're in French. No, I've not managed to glean anything terribly juicy yet. I used my debit card for the first time today. Now I'm terrified that I'll end up bankrupt, whether by someone stealing all my details, or by me getting carried away with the ease of this online purchasing lark. On the upside, I seem to have been paid by the university for the work I have allegedly done so far. Yay! I've not got a useful context, but given the day that's in it, the phrase "Now is the winter of our discothéque..." has formulated itself in my head and will not go away.
