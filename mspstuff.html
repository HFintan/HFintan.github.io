    <h1>What I'm currently working on</h1>
    
    <h2>
Current project: Automate fence sizing.    </h2>
Perl and sed appear unhelpful for seaching and replacing across lines, so I'm going to do this all in the form of a vim macro,
which won't be pretty, so I'll probably stick it in a separate file eventually.<br>
    Anyway, the basic idea is to replace all variants of parentheses with <b>\left(</b> and <b>\right)</b> (which we don't want
    in the finished product) respectively, and then, according
    to their contents, assign them the desired \Bigg, \bigg, \Big, \big, or leave them as ( .<br>
    I've decided to do this only within display mode, for the sake of my sanity. So, the steps are:<br>
    <h4>1. Identify bits in display mode </h4> 
    <h4>2. Reduce all the parens within display mode to <b>\left</b> </h4>
    <h4>3. Make a list of things that need Bigg, bigg, Big, and big parens </h4>
    <h4>4. Search through the displays and find parens and add in Biggs where necessary, then biggs, etc.</h4>
    <h4>5. ????</h4>
    <h4>6. Profit!</h4>
    <br><br>
   
    <h3> Identify bits in display mode</h3>
    <it>(Issue: Want to avoid diagrams) </it><br>
    For <b>\begin{align}</b> environments, etc, this should be easy - PROVIDED there are none of these 
    "display-creating" environments contained within each other. I think we might be okay on this front - <b>\begin{alignat}</b>
    and <b>\begin{split}</b> need to be within display-mode already, and no-one puts a <b>\begin{align}</b>
    within a <b>\begin{align}</b>. Some of the plain tex stuff, like <b>displaylines</b> and <b>eqalign</b> etc do
    get nested, but again, they need to be placed within math.<br>
    So the tricky display mode is the one which is surrounded simply by <b>$$</b> <b>$$</b>. This is fixable using<br><br>
    <font size="4">
    <code>:let a=['$$%FHENDDISPLAY','%FHBEGINDISPLAY$$']^M</code><br>
    <code>\ :%s/\$\$/\=reverse(a)[0]/ge^M</code><br>
    <code>\ :%s/%FHBEGINDISPLAY\$\$/%FHBEGINDISPLAY\r\$\$/ge^M</code><br>
    <code>\ :%s/\$\$%FHENDDISPLAY/\$\$\r%FHENDDISPLAY/ge^M</code><br><br>
    </font>
      The first line creates a list whose items we will alternate between (assuming there are no odd <b>$$</b> in a comment somewhere
    - that
    would mess this up royally), and replace <b>$$</b> with. The second two lines are just for breaking these replacements onto
      separate lines for aesthetic and not-effing-everything-up purposes.<br>
    For <b>\begin{align}</b> etc., we will want to replace each instance using, say
     <font size="4">
       <code>:%s/\\begin{align}/%FHBEGINDISPLAY\\begin{align}/ge^M</code><br>
       <code>:%s/\\end{align}/\\end{align}%FHENDDISPLAY/ge^M</code><br>
    </font>
    (Then the last two lines of the previous code snippet will split these into two lines as required.)<br>
    This is straightforward, but the interesting part here is that I don't want to have to write out these two lines for
    each of <b>align</b>, <b>align*</b>, <b>equation</b>, <b>equation*</b>, and what have you - especially as this list
    may grow over time. Therefore, I would like to be able to loop over a list of such terms. I have not yet figured out how
    to do this.
    
    <h3> Reduce all the parens within display mode to <b>\left</b><h3>
      Again, there is a large list of these to account for (<b>bigl</b>,<b>Bigl</b>,<b>biggl</b>,<b>Bigl</b>,
      <b>big</b>,<b>left</b>, but the general formula is
      <font size="4">
        <code>s/%FHBEGINDISPLAY\(\_.\{-}\)\\bigl(\(\_.\{-}\)%FHENDDISPLAY/\1\\left(\2%FHENDDISPLAY^M</code>
      </font>
      Unfortunately, this would require multiple iterations in case there are multiple bigls in a display environment, as is very
      likely. Therefore, there this is perhaps better done with sed. Who knows, this may even make it easier to iterate over a
      number of list entries.
      To use sed to replace, use
      <font size="4">
        <code>:! sed -i '/FHBEGINCOMMENT/,/FHENDCOMMENT/s/bigl(/left(/g' main.tex
