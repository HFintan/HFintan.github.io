<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 13th</span></big>
<p>I've been in Birmingham for an entire day now and it has not stopped raining. I spent five hours in the library yesterday while waiting for check-in for the hotel. Granted, I was asleep for a substantial portion of that time, but I feel it's a step in the right direction. This morning, I wandered out to the area where I'm thinking of renting. It looks like a bit of a hole, but I asked a local shopkeep, and he informed me that it was a lovely and safe area. Then he sold me a packet of cookies which were seven months out of date. Caveat emptor, I suppose...
On the upside, I saw my first grey squirrel ever, so the trip hasn't been a complete waste. I've only ever seen one red squirrel before - in Germany, twenty-three years ago. Gone in the blink of an eye.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 14th</span></big>
<p> I wandered down to a local chipper yesterday evening. First I was stopped by a man with blood all down his face who claimed he'd been mugged and was looking for £2 for the bus home. Even if he was just scamming me, I appreciated the effort he had put in, so I gave him the money and went on my way. Five minutes later I was done out of another couple of quid by someone with no story whatsoever - I resented that one, but given that I was carrying a couple of hundred in my pocket, I didn't want to prolong our interaction. Makes one appreciate the buskers and sitting beggars one finds in Galway - not something I'd expected to miss. Met the supervisor and some admin staff today - the most fun part of which was the delightful "Catch 22" of needing a residential address to open a bank account and a bank account to rent a property. It took me hours to get around that one. Advice to those of you who might find yourselves in a similar situation - use Lloyd's.
Then I viewed the house I'm thinking of renting, which didn't look quite as well as in the photographs...<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 15th</span></big>
<p> Was panicking a bit last night, but I met with the supervisor today and it seems things may be workable after all. I also found out why I was hired, despite an absolutely terrible phone interview, over everyone else - it was because I could start immediately. I am so proud. Also went to Birmingham City and spent a full hour being directed from pillar to post and back again, before finally finding the estate agent's office to promise them all of my money, five minutes walk from where I'd first asked for directions. On my travels, I was approached by a young lass who claimed she was a photography student doing a fashion shoot. Readers who know me, which presumably covers all of you, may recall that I am not the most fashionable of individuals, or you might recall the episode of Black Books where Manny runs away and is taken in by a kindly photographer. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNWNeXYJVA8">Watch it</a>  - it's good! Personally, I was reminded of what the lovely Alan (aka ddy) said about me back in 2009:
<p><i>Imagining you doing a fashion show is frightening.<br>

"Well you need a jacket with massive pockets to fit lots of jaffa cakes in.."</i><p>
Anyway, I declined her offer. I also bought a new phone in Carphone Warehouse, and the box promised a sim card and a micro sim card, but unless they were both very fucking micro indeed, there seemed to be no sim card at all. Yay.
Went to the UoB chess club and managed not to lose any games, but there was apparently a team match on which all the best players are at.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 16th</span></big>
<p> Seems the University here uses Windows 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Outlook - and they wonder why everything is so painfully slow. Had lunch with a friend of a friend of a friend today, in the interests of not becoming a recluse. Coincidentally, this friend of a friend of a friend was one of the people I stopped to ask for directions in the city centre yesterday. Small world, eh?
On my way home, I was attacked by a crow. Nothing too traumatic - it cawed harshly at me as I passed, and then flew over my head and flapped its wings at my hair a little, and then returned to its perch on the railing. What a dick. The sun came out for the first time since I've arrived, so I took the evening off and spent it watching cheery youtube videos, like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKC-lRhvdNY>this one</a>.<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 17th</span></big>
<p> I saw THREE squirrels this morning. One of them jumped FROM one tree TO another. And sure isn't that about all you could want from a morning? I also got a text from 02:
"<i>Want to know more about what impact the Tuam Sugar Factory has on Galway, its people and the surrounding areas? Make sure to check out TG4 Croi an Cheantair, anocht at 8pm. This is the second in a six part series. T&Cs apply.</i>"
I also did some maths research today and understood some stuff, which was fun. Then I came home and found that the cleaner had removed my toothbrush and toothpaste. Maybe they're going to clone me or something.<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 18th</span></big>
<p> Saw two squirrels this morning, and one of them even jumped from one tree to another, but it wasn't quite as exciting this time around. However, I did see my first ever jay and tufted ducks this morning, and a squirrel on the ground only a few metres away from me. These, all while I walked to the next town to deposit all of my money in the estate agents' bank account.
I spent a lot of time in the office doing very little today, but became acutely aware of the music school just at the back of our office. It's great to have a music school, don't get me wrong, and it's nice to here the sounds of the piano drift up of an evening, but today there was a soprano practising scales for over an hour and it did my fecking head in. Like something from a haunting horror film.
The previous debacle over needing an address for a bank account and a bank account for an address resulted in my having given the hotel as my address. This was a matter for some concern, as after tonight it will no longer be my address. Fortunately, however, the mail arrived today and I am now the proud owner of a shiny new debit card. It was no longer possible to avoid getting one. Now I'll probably go mad and buy everything on the internet.<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 19th</span></big>
<p> I had to laugh earlier when I saw the "Customers must be eighteen or over to purchase this product." sticker on a box of cutlery. I'm not laughing now, as I bleed all over the keyboard, after slicing my finger when removing one of the knives from its packaging. I bled a little on my pizza too, but that's okay, because it was carbonised beyond edibility in this oven which has a number of unhelpful settings, illustrated by unintelligible little diagrams. The washer-dryer seems a little more straightforward, except the "dryer" part of it does not seem at all effective. I am in my new house, in case you had not guessed, where I shall be for the next six months unless I want to forfeit a rather hefty £1200 deposit. I had not expected my stay in Birmingham to be a financially profitable one, but it would be nice if it doesn't end up eating into my savings.<br>
I was feeling reasonably optimistic when I arrived at my new lodgings, but, while looking out a window where I was initially reassured to see a child's play house in the back yard of the house next door, its plastic door having been chewed to shreds and the many massive lumps of shit lying about the yard suggesting that it is being used as a kennel instead, took the rather thin sheen of things. Probably for the best, as there were bags of rubbish stacked atop the plastic house, and it would probably have been none too sanitary accommodation for a child. The thin walls later informed me that there are, in fact, a dog and at least two very young children in the house. Having lived in a detached house all my life, it's going to be difficult not to get anxious every time I hear a noise pretty much anywhere.<br>
I called in to Carphone Warehouse today, so 02 will post me out a new sim card. However, not wishing to be unable to communicate with you, dear reader, as the Maths department seems to be inconveniently closed on the weekends, I spent £60 on a dongle, which I'm sure is a stupid amount. I haven't figured out how to turn on the heating. <br>
There are peculiar scratchmarks on the door from the kitchen into the rest of the house. I do hope the house isn't haunted or troubled by junkies.<br>
I've been in Birmingham for a week now and, aside from the accommodation, I reckon I'd be happy enough here for a few months at least. If I managed to get a barge for my next accommodation though, that would be pretty awesome, I suspect.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 20th</span></big>
<p> Well, I survived my first night in the new house. For those of you who may be anxious about such things, I also survived the second - I am writing this the following morning just to be sure. It was a remarkably unproductive day, leaving me with almost an entire maths paper to read tomorrow. Such foolishness is ill-advised. I did find the direct route to the nearby shopping centres, which, though I had to pass a couple of nasty-looking types with nasty-looking dogs, saved me about twenty minutes' walk. In Homebase I purchased a duvet, a sheet, a duvet cover, and two pillows, courtesy of which I have just woken up in my new bed rather than on the couch the night before. I also purchased, with some difficulty, a set of towels - the difficulty arising because the lass in the shop could not understand me when I was saying "towels" repeatedly. I always thought I was a fairly intelligible guy. In the end I said "For drying yourself?" and she understood and added an extra syllable and promptly directed me to the tow-els.<br>
A craftier individual would no doubt have gone to Sainsbury's to purchase his sandwiches for dinner and popping them in his rucksack before wandering around Homebase, but I elected, instead, to carry all my purchases around Sainsbury's while doing my shopping. This led to security coming after me outside afterwards and interrogating me. Fortunately, I still had the Homebase receipt crumpled up in my pocket and am an understanding person.<br>
I had to go through the inventory list the estate agent provided this evening. This involved going through the entire house as though I were my mother, finding whichever defects the four-hundred photographs the estate agent provided did not. There's a sign on the wall outside that says "SORRY ITS LET". I am sorely tempted to find a marker and somehow lean out and add the missing apostrophe.<br>
It's going to take me a while to get used to this living in a terraced house lark. Every time I hear a noise, I'm convinced it's someone trying to break in. I'm a nervous wreck.
The previous tenants also seem to have a left a pair of sheer Calvin Klein tights behind, still in their original packing. They are probably too small for me, however, so if anyone wants them or can think of something constructive to use them for, other than robbing a bank, let me know.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 21st</span></big>
<p> 
There's an awful lot of gas in this house, and I'm not simply referring to the extra flatulence caused by the copious amounts of white bread and chocolate I'm eating. The radiators and the shower are run off the gas, and possibly the electricity, but there'll be no saving two hundred pounds a year for me, I can tell you... Anyway, the boiler is right above the toilet, so I won't have the heat on while I'm sitting on the loo for fear of it exploding and leaving me in an almighty mess. I'm still coming to grips with the shower - and the boiler has to be on while the shower is being used, and you're standing right there, naked both metaphorically and physically, listening to the flame popping just a few feet away, waiting to be blown to smithereens.<br> 
I spent the entire day today lying in the new bed, but kept falling asleep while trying to read the maths paper. Suppose you have an <i>n x m</i> matrix <i>A</i>, where <i>m</i> is much greater than <i>n</i>, and a vector <i>x</i> and their product is <i>b</i>. There are thus many possible solutions for <i>x</i>. However, if most of the entries in <i>x</i> are zero, then the system becomes solvable. So the problem is to uniquely minimise the number of non-zero entries in <i>x</i> subject to <i>b=Ax</i>. What's the problem?<br>
I also spent some time googling crime stats for Birmingham - nothing restful about that, I can assure you.<br>
I think someone stole a couple of my bins.<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 22nd</span></big>
<p>Met the supervisor thi morning, and even though I hadn't quite read all of the paper he'd given me last week, everything went fine. Then he gave me ten more papers to read for this week, so clearly we have differing ideas about the pace at which I should be progresssing. Anyway, with the meeting over for this week, I duly did no more work for the rest of the day. Threw together a chess email for old times' sake and faffed about on the internet until it was time to go to chess. Lost a couple of games which was reassuring, but only one guy I played actually deserved to beat me, and that was pretty close. I was Black in a pretty standard Queen's Gambit and missed a pawn fork about twenty moves in, for those of you who might be interested. To be fair, though, I couldn't castle and he had a rook on semi-open e-file, so it was always going to be troublesome. Then we went to the pub. There are some fecking weird people in Birmingham.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 23rd</span></big>
<p> Recall how I cut my finger on that crappy knife during the week? Well, this evening I've cut my thumb. These knives appear to be bluntly serrated at the top, with an explicable sharp edge on the lower half of the handle. For what, I do not know...
Did sweet feck all work today. Apparently Mark from NUIG ChessSoc is starting a job over here soon too. Small world. And it seems ChessSoc are going to karaoke in my absence. Where will it all end?
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 27th</span></big>

Was back in Ireland for the weekend, the details of which I feel completely justified in not being arsed sharing with you, and am back in B'ham now. Transit wasn't terribly exciting, although one flight being delayed by an hour meant we were spared the triumphant Ryanair "on-time" jingle. The poxy hour change meant I had to spend an extra hour waiting in the airport, and the trains didn't start until an hour after  the flight landed - I need to time my trips more carefully in future. I got stopped going through security for the odd-seeming bunch of coins on the underwater chess board. I also got stuck in a queue behind some of the Welsh basketball team and some guy who'd been on Xfactor. Twats. I spent most of today catching up on the sleep I missed out on while travelling, and spent most of last Thursday sleeping in preparation for same, so have not got much to report. I do notice that all of my mail seems to have "Dr." as my title, which is somewhat bothersome. I do not recall passing such instruction to anyone, as it gives the impression that I am both wealthy and have access to drugs, neither of which I want to be widely believed. 
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 28th</span></big>

I saw a rat this morning on my way in to college. And I finally rang about getting my National Insurance Number, which seems to be something like a PPS number, and it seems I have to go to London for an appointment to get one. Ridiculous. Then I spent the entire day reading a maths paper, the general gist of which was that when solving y=Ax, it can be helpful to add a weighting matrix y=AWx, and, further, it is helpful to reweight this matrix at each iteration, with each w(t)=1/(w(t-1)+ &epsilon; ) subject to y=AWx. I even tried an example, with actual numbers, and it seemed to work. That is, of course, assuming that my understanding of the entire business is not fundamentally flawed. 
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 29th</span></big>
<p>
I spent all of today reading some paper which I still do not understand.
In the evening I went to chess and lost more games than I should have. The highlight of the evening was, of course, when some guy said to me - "<i>You must be pretty good. I find that older guys are usually better at chess.</i>" Sigh.
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 30th</span></big>
<p> It occurs to me that if I spend all my time researching as I ought, then this blog can not but become a little tedious, and somewhat unworthy of the "Adventures" in the title. I understood next to nothing of the paper I spent today reading part of, though I did watch some nice <a href=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/>linear algebra videos</a>. I also purchased a copy of Pirates of the Carribean from an NSPCC stall, but it transpired that the copy was, in a cross between irony and eponymity, pirated. I saw the film in the cinema when it first came out, and I got to relive the cinema experience this evening, complete with people giggling and walking over and back in front of the screen, as recorded on a high-definition toaster. It just goes to show - you can't trust the NSPCC. 
<p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 31st</span></big>
<p>This morning I spent £10 on a phonecall organising to pay £68 for house contents insurance for the house. The laptop isn't included, so I don't even have £68's worth of stuff. Then I spent the day reading research papers to try to understand another research paper, but I couldn't even understand them, so that wasn't terribly helpful. Then I bought a load of chocolate to ward off any little egg-flinging fuckers who might have called to the house, but none did, so I gorged. Still have loads left over. Bleugh.<br>
Also, it occurs to me - I haven't seen a single deli here where you can get a roll made. They're <i>everywhere</i> in Ireland, but not here for some reason. All my sandwiches are pre-packed. Chicken and stuffing, and tuna, onion and cabbage today. Cabbage. I ask you.
