<br>
As part of the Theoretical and Computational Optimization Research Group in the University of Birmingham, 
I am collaborating to develop a generic algorithmic framework and convergence theory for seeking the sparsest
solution of a general model. This work has applications in signal recovery and denoising, image reconstruction, 
statistical estimation, and ﬁnancial engineering amongst others. More speciﬁcally, I am working on the construction
and manipulation of deterministic and structured compressed sensing matrices and algorithms for efﬁcient recovery
of compressed data.
<br><br>
My doctoral thesis focused on developing some theory and software for efficiently computing the homology of Euclidean data sets in up to four dimensions. This software was an extension of work done by Graham Ellis as part of <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/www/">Hap</a>, a homological algebra library for use with the <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a> computer algebra system. This extension exploited certain mathematical advantages of using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutohedron">permutahedra</a>lly-based  structures, rather than traditional simplicial or cubical ones, to speed up and expand the scope of certain implementations of homological image computations.
<br>
The software should be available here soon, along with the relevant manual, tutorial and libraries.
<br><br>
<!--In the future, I would be interestd in the possibility of using the software to analyse medical data. Theoretically, the software and methods could, for example, be useful for efficient, automated detection, identification and monitoring of cancerous areas in MRI or CAT scans of the prostate. The issue is that the software deals with binary data, and further work on the image segmentation is needed to suitably process the medical data into binary form. Amongst other approaches, I would like to consider shape reconstruction from shading to investigate the possibility of improving the software's recognition capabilities, focusing perhaps on detecting macular degeneration and similar optical defects.

To see how the manifold nature of permutahedral complexes can be advantageously applied to knot computations in the real world, see the paper <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00200-014-0244-1">Computing Fundamental Groups from Point Clouds</a> by Brendel, D&#322;otko, Ellis, Juda, and Mrozek, which investigates the application to the analysis of protein complexes.

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">A couple of toy examples</span></big>
<br><br>
Suppose you have a block of Maasdam, and want to know how many tunnels there are running through the cheese, and how many voids or 'bubbles' are contained therein.
<br>
<center><img style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" src="images/originalcheese.jpg";"/></center>
<br><br>

Using highly sophisticated methods we can convert this three-dimensional object into a sequence of two-dimensional slices...
<br>
<center><img style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" src="images/cheesewithknife.jpg";"/></center>
<br><br>
<center><img style="width: 150px; height: 251px;" src="images/shrunkcheese1.jpg";"/><img style="width: 150px; height: 251px;" src="images/shrunkcheese2.jpg";"/><img style="width: 150px; height: 251px;" src="images/shrunkcheese3.jpg";"/></center>
<br><br>
And then read these into the computer...
<center><img style="width: 150px; height: 251px;" src="images/usegappedcheese1.jpg";"/><img style="width: 150px; height: 251px;" src="images/usegappedcheese2.jpg";"/><img style="width: 150px; height: 251px;" src="images/usegappedcheese3.jpg";"/></center>

The following series of GAP commands provide some information about the original block of cheese. The <tt>Size</tt> function returns the number of coloured voxels in our data set, and the two <tt>ContractedComplex</tt> functions reduce the size of the data set but, crucially, do <i>not</i> change the number of components, holes, tunnels, or voids in the data set.
<br><tt><b>gap> X:=ReadImageSequence([threecheeseslices]);;<br>
gap> Size(X);<br>
441922<br>
gap> ContX:=ContractedComplex(X);;time;<br>
10 seconds<br>
gap> Size(ContX);<br>
6208<br>
gap> ZZContX:=ZigZagContractedComplex(ContX);;time;<br>
22 seconds<br>
gap> Size(ZZContX);<br>
1042<br>
gap> Bettinumbers(ZZContX);time;<br>
[1,9,1,0]<br>
5 seconds</b></tt>
<br>
These Bettinumbers tell us that our initial block of cheese was a single connected object, had 9 tunnels running through it, and had 1 "bubble" inside it.

	<img class="floatleft" style="width: 300px; height: 224px; float:left; padding:10px" src="images/photo3.jpg"/>

	<div class="txt"">
	<p> <br>In this example, we are presented with a selection of nuts, bolts and washers, and use our software to distinguish between them.<br>
<tt><b>gap> A:=ReadImage("bits.jpg",250);;<br>
gap> View(A);</b></tt><br> The "250" is an RGB threshold value, dictating which pixels should be deemed "present" in the data set.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br><br>

<div> <img style="width: 300px; height: 224px; float:right; padding:10px" src="images/photogap2.jpg"/> Here we create a copy of the image without bolts, by creating an empty image of the same size and then adding in all of the objects with Euler characteristic 0. Any object which is homotopy equivalent to a circle will have Euler characteristic 0 - ie. this includes washers and nuts, but not bolts. The <tt><b>PathComponent(A,n)</b></tt> function selects the <i>n</i>th object in the data set <b>A</b>, except where n=0, in which case the function returns the number of separate objects in <b>A</b>.<br>
<tt><b>gap> B=PureComplex(A!.binaryArray*0);;<br>
gap> for i in [1..PathComponent(A,0)] do<br>
> if EulerCharacteristic(PathComponent(A,i))=0 then<br>
> B:=PureComplexUnion(B,PathComponent(A,i));;<br>
> fi; od; <br></b></tt>
</div>

<div> <img style="width:300px; height: 224px; float: left; padding:10px" src="images/photogap3.jpg"/> Washers and nuts are homotopy equivalent - both contain exactly one hole. However, the nuts have some corners, which are not found on the smooth boundary of the washers. The function <tt><b>Singularities</b></tt> identifies these corners, with two threshold values (in this case 5 and 50) defining what we are regarding as a "corner".<br>
<tt><b>gap> C:=PureComplex(B!.binaryArray*0);;<br>
gap> for i in [1..PathComponent(B,0)] do<br>
> if Size(Singularities(PathComponent(B,i),5,50)=0 then<br>
> C:=Union(C,PathComponent(B,i));;<br>
> fi;od;</b></tt>
</div>

	<div class="txt"">
	<p> If we intuitively "thicken" the remaining objects, we might expect that the holes in some will disappear before others. We can thus, by monitoring the Euler characteristic of the objects, identify the washers by size. The "7" here was chosen because it gave the clearest results for this example, but is of no other particular significance.
