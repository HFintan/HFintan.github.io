<i>Current research</i>
<br>
<b>Mathematics Education and Data Analysis</b> Working with Patrick Browne of Limerick Institute of Technology and Paul Greaney of Letterkenny Institute of Technology on a SATLE-funded 
mathematics education/data analysis project to lead second-level teachers in implementing an online system to assist with students' transition from
second- to third-level study.
<br><br>
<b>Computer Science Education and Machine Learning</b> Leading a research group with participants ranging from second-level students to postgraduates and industry
professionals as a case study in using game implementation as a method of teaching computer science (programming, web services and machine learning).
<br>
<i>Previous research</i>
<br>
<b>Combinatorics</b> 
<a href="compressed_sensing.html"><b>Compressed Sensing</b>: </a><br> As part of the Theoretical and Computational Optimization Research Group in the University of Birmingham, 
I worked on compressed sensing --  branch of signal processing. This area has applications in signal recovery and denoising, image reconstruction, 
statistical estimation, and ﬁnancial engineering, amongst others. More speciﬁcally, I worked on the construction
and manipulation of deterministic and structured compressed sensing matrices and algorithms for efﬁcient recovery
of compressed data.
<br><br>
<a href="computational_homology.html"> <b>Computational Homology</b></a>:<br>
My doctoral thesis focused on developing some theory and software for efficiently computing the homology of Euclidean data 
sets in up to four dimensions. This software was an extension of work done by Graham Ellis as part of 
<a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/www/">HAP</a>, a homological algebra library for use with 
the <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a> computer algebra system. This extension exploited certain mathematical 
advantages of using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutohedron">permutahedra</a>lly-based  structures, rather 
than traditional simplicial or cubical ones, to speed up and expand the scope of certain implementations of homological 
image computations. Further details are available <a href="computational_homology.html">here</a> or see
my <a href="pdfs/presentation.pdf">thesis defence slides</a> or <a href="pdfs/blitzpresentation.pdf">this blitz presentation</a>
for some toy examples.

<!--In the future, I would be interestd in the possibility of using the software to analyse medical data. Theoretically, the software and methods could, for example, be useful for efficient, automated detection, identification and monitoring of cancerous areas in MRI or CAT scans of the prostate. The issue is that the software deals with binary data, and further work on the image segmentation is needed to suitably process the medical data into binary form. Amongst other approaches, I would like to consider shape reconstruction from shading to investigate the possibility of improving the software's recognition capabilities, focusing perhaps on detecting macular degeneration and similar optical defects.

<!--To see how the manifold nature of permutahedral complexes can be advantageously applied to knot computations in the real world, see the paper <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00200-014-0244-1">Computing Fundamental Groups from Point Clouds</a> by Brendel, D&#322;otko, Ellis, Juda, and Mrozek, which investigates the application to the analysis of protein complexes.
